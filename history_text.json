    "text": "Dutch and English manorial lords owned much of the fertile east bank of the Hudson River, where they leased farms on perpetual contracts to German tenants and refused to sell land to freehold-seeking migrants from overcrowded New England. This powerful landed elite produced aristocratic-minded Patriot leaders such as Gouverneur Morris and Robert Livingston, as well as prominent American families such as the Roosevelts."

Traditionally, New England\nshoemakers had turned leather hides into finished shoes and boots in small wooden shacks called “ten-footers,” where they worked at their own pace."

After inventors in the 1850s figured out how to extract kerosene — a clean-burning fuel for domestic heating and light- ing — from crude oil, enormous oil deposits were dis- covered at Titusville, Pennsylvania."

    "text": "Like Carnegie and Swift, Rockefeller succeeded through vertical integration: to control production and sales all the way from the oil well to the kerosene lamp, he took a big stake in the oil fields, added pipelines, and developed a vast distribution network."

    "text": "Rockefeller also pioneered a strategy called hori- zontal integration. After driving competitors to the brink of failure through predatory pricing, he invited them to merge their local companies into his conglom- erate."

    "text": "Before the Civil War, most American boys had hoped to become farmers, small-business owners, or independent artisans. Afterward, more and more Americans—both male and female—began working for someone else. Because they wore white shirts with starched collars, those who held professional positions in corporations became known as white-collar workers, a term differen- tiating them from blue-collar employees, who labored with their hands."

In the Atlantic, U-boats devastated American\nconvoys carrying oil and other vital supplies to Britain and the Soviet Union."
